# How-Does-Climate-Change-Influence-Regional-Instability-
Climate Change is rapidly increasing in todays world.  As it does, it affects how fragile the govern-ments of countries around the world are becoming.  In order to attempt to begin to mitigate these affects, climate change's impact on governmental fragility must be understood.

In order to have received an honorable mention, these tasks had to be fulfilled:

Task 1: Develop a model that determines a country’s fragility and simultaneously measures the impact of climate change. Your model should identify when a state is fragile, vulnerable, or stable. It should also identify how climate change increases fragility through direct means or indirectly as it influences other factors and indicators.

Task 2: Select one of the top 10 most fragile states as determined by the Fragile State Index (http://fundforpeace.org/fsi/data/) and determine how climate change may have increased fragility of that country. Use your model to show in what way(s) the state may be less fragile without these effects.

Task 3: Use your model on another state not in the top 10 list to measure its fragility, and see in what way and when climate change may push it to become more fragile. Identify any definitive indicators. How do you define a tipping point and predict when a country may reach it?

Task 4: Use your model to show which state driven interventions could mitigate the risk of climate change and prevent a country from becoming a fragile state. Explain the effect of human intervention and predict the total cost of intervention for this country.

Task 5: Will your model work on smaller “states” (such as cities) or larger “states” (such as continents)? If not, how would you modify your model?
